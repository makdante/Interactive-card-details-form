## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- JQuery Inputmask
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt about the <strong>JQuery</strong> JavaScript Library. It made writing javascript code very simple and easy.<br>
I learnt about <strong>Javascript Input validation</strong>,<strong>Events</strong> and <strong>Event Handlers</strong>.<br>
I used the <strong>JQuery Inputmask</strong> to create the input mask for the input fields. Paticularily for the card number input field.this code created the inputmask and then applied to the card number input field.
```js
  const cnum_im = new Inputmask({
    mask:"**** **** **** ****",
    placeholder:" ",
  });
  cnum_im.mask(cnum);
```


### Useful resources

- [JQuery Inputmask Docs](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask) - Inputmask is an amazing JavaScript library that helped me create input mask for any input fields.
